**Version:** v0.1 (Frozen Core)  
**Status:** Public Draft

## What is AIROS?

AIROS (AI Responsible Operations Standard) is an open, evolving effort to make high-impact AI systems safer, more accountable, and operationally trustworthy in the real world.

This document defines the non-negotiable core around which all future AIROS work must be built.  
It is intentionally minimal.

---

## 1. Human Responsibility Is Irreducible
AI systems do not bear responsibility.  
Every AI system that can materially affect people, rights, safety, or access to opportunity must have clearly identified human ownership for its design, deployment, and operation.  

Responsibility cannot be delegated to software.

---

## 2. Risk Determines Rigor
Governance must scale with the severity and reversibility of harm.

- Low-risk systems should not be overburdened.  
- High-risk systems must not be under-governed.

---

## 3. Evidence Matters More Than Intent
Claims of responsibility, fairness, or safety are insufficient.  

Organizations must produce verifiable operational evidence showing how systems behave, fail, and recover.

---

## 4. Purpose Must Be Explicit and Bounded
AI systems must be evaluated against a declared operational purpose.  

Using systems beyond declared purpose introduces unmeasured risk.

---

## 5. Failure Is Inevitable; Silence Is Not Acceptable
Failures must:  
- Be detectable  
- Be investigable  
- Trigger corrective action  

Opaque failure is unacceptable in high-impact roles.

---

## 6. Transparency Must Be Practical
Transparency means providing sufficient, meaningful insight into system behavior — not exposing proprietary code.

---

## 7. Accountability Should Not Be Optional
Complexity, automation, or scale must not be used to evade responsibility.

---

## 8. AIROS Is a Technical Standard, Not a Law
AIROS provides operational clarity to help organizations meet legal, ethical, and societal obligations.

---

## 9. AIROS Is Open to Scrutiny
This standard is open to criticism, debate, and improvement.  
Disagreement is expected; silence is not.

---

## 10. What This Core Does Not Define (Yet)
AIROS does not yet define:  
- Certification  
- Enforcement  
- Governance body  
- Legal liability allocation  

These will evolve through collaboration and evidence.

---

## Governance Notice
AIROS is currently stewarded as an open initiative by Avyon.  
The standard is publicly available and open for review.
